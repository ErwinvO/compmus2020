I will be looking at the differences between Mark Knopfler's writing and producing for Dire Straits and his solo projects. Although Mark Knopfler has been at the helm for both artists as songwriter and main producer, Dire Straits has been more succesful than his solo music, leading me to believe there are some key differences between the music of Dire Straits and the music of Mark Knopfler.

Some interesting features for both Dire Straits and Mark Knopfler is that for a lot of the variables, the median is so low that the SD would at its lowest be sub-zero. For instance, for music that is largely based around solos for both acoustic and electric guitar, it is at least worth noting that this is the case for instrumentalness (M = 0,31 and 0,23, SD = 0,32 and 0,26). 

Despite technological advancements, Dire Straits' music is significantly louder (M = -10 and M = -13, SD = 2,8 and 4,5). This might have something to do with how "natural" the mastering is, as louder masters tend to be more "squashed" by compression.

Although Mark Knopfler "talk-sings" (or recites), speechiness is quite low for both Dire Straits (M = 0,04) and his solo work (M = 0,03).

Most significantly, Mark Knopfler's solo music is lower-energy (M = 0,38, SD = 0,21) and more acoustic (M = 0,63 and SD = 0,26) than Dire straits (respectively M = 0,62 and SD = 0,21, and M = 0,29 and SD = 0,25). Remarkably, both discographies seem to be equally dancable, despite the differences in energy levels (M = 0,59 and 0,53 with SD = around 1,5).

These numbers are of course not set in stone, I might filter the results to only show studio-albums and omit soundtracks. Nevertheless, the results so far lead me to conclude that there are in fact significant differences between the two discographies.
